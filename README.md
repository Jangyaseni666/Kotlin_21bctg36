# App LifeCycle:

The life cycle entails opening the app, performing a task and killing the app. It is also called as activity lifecycle.
The lifecycle methods are:  onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onDestroy
- When app is first launched, onCreate function is called. One time setup is written inside this function
- onStart is called when the activity is visible to the user.
- onResume is called when the user is interacting with the activity.
- onPause is called when the user is about to leave the activity. Ex: When we get a notification from another app and we click on the notification.
- onStop is called when system puts the activity in the background, and another activity is about to start
- onDestroy is called to kill the activity
